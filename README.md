Hello! To use the ziptrainer, download this repo, navigate to the directory in your terminal, and run `python3 ziptrainer.py`. Press `ctrl + C` to exit.

You can configure the script by editing the `INPUT_DELAY_SEC`, `INPUT_WINDOW_SEC`, and `FPS` global variables. They're at the top of the script. I wasn't sure what the timings are for a zip, so at present you'll have to adjust that yourself :)

At this point the only key recognized by the script is W. If this script is useful I'd be happy to add more inputs.
